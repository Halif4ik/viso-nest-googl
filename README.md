# Test_Tasks Back End Viso
## Description:
This project serves as the back end for a test task. It provides various API endpoints for managing. The application is built using NestJS, a powerful framework for building scalable and maintainable
server-side applications.
I used for check on this endpoint- http://localhost:3008/.

## Installation:
Before running the application, create a .env file with the necessary environment variables, as specified in the sample
file. Then, install the dependencies and start the application:
```
yarn install

nest start --watch
